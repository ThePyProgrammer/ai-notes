title: Agentic AI

I've been looking into a lot of Agentic AI-related stuff, especially since the release of the amazing [Foundation Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01990) that define a formal definition for an agent that might mimic the human-level of cognition.

I also got a chance to interact with [Mark Vero](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/markvero) from the [SRI Lab @ ETH Zurich](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) during ICLR 2025, exchanging ideas on [LLM Anonymization](agents/anonymization.md).
