This is my safe haven to share my notes about AI Research. Some of the domains I've explored here are:
- [AI Safety](ai-safety/index.md) (see my notes from various [AI Safety-related Talks](ai-safety/talks/index.md))
- [Foundation Models](./foundation-models)
- [Time-Series Modelling](time-series-modelling/index.md)

You could also find out more about my prior work:
- [My Research](self/research/index.md)

I hope you enjoy reading this!
