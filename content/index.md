This is my safe haven to share my notes about AI Research. Some of the domains I've explored here are:
- [AI Safety](ai-safety/index.md)
- [Foundation Models](./foundation-models)
- [Time-Series Modelling](time-series-modelling/index.md)

I hope you enjoy reading this!

Some features:
- Check out my notes from the recent [Large Model Safety Workshop 2025](ai-safety/lmxsafety-25.md), and other [Talks](ai-safety/talks/index.md).
- Read about my previous research on [WalledEval](self/research/walledeval.md), a LLM Safety Evaluation Toolkit.
- Check out my summary of [LASTS](time-series-modelling/LASTS.md), a Time Series Interpretability method.
