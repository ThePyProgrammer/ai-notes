title: AI Safety
---
I've explored a lot in the domain of AI Safety, having built a test suite and toolkit named [WalledEval](../self/research/walledeval.md) with my mentor, [Rishabh Bhardwaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-bhardwaj-nlp).

I also had the privilege of attending the [LM Safety Workshop 2025](./lmxsafety-25.md) in Singapore this year.

In addition, I had the privilege to attend the Opening Keynote of ICLR 2025 by Prof Zico Kolter from CMU. I have summarised my notes here: [Building Safe and Robust AI Systems](talks/safe-robust-ai.md).
