title: Time-Series Modelling
---
In AETHER, we focus a lot on Time Series Modelling, specifically on Multivariate EEG Time Series Modelling (see [Preliminaries](prelims.md)).

Here are some of the key problems we are tackling:
- Training [Time Series Models](model_dump.md)
- [Time Series Interpretability](interp.md)

You can also check my prior work in Time Series Modelling for [Gait Monitoring in Parkinson's Patients](](../self/research/gait-monitoring.md)).
